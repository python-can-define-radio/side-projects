Problem: delivery is restricted to 5840 bytes.
Possible solution steps:
 - Try re-implementing sendall using repeated send() with a small time sleep in between.
   to ensure that that's not the problem. If that doesn't solve it
 - change function so that cross-tunnel communication is distinct from local communication.
 - For cross-tunnel, instead of using sendall:
   for piece in chunked(alldata, 1000):
     open socket
     send("content:" + piece)
     close socket
   open socket
   send("end of message")
   close socket
   Then shut the connection
 - Receiving:
   This will be hard, so I don't know whether it's worth it yet
