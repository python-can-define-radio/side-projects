Make interaction of some sort, hopefully involving EM waves, probably some other fun stuff like fireballs that come from a box

- How to change location?
- 

- NPC (commanding officer) that provides mission
- Entering a game level, being 'transported' to a new location
- dialog -> brief on the mission
  - press 'begin' / 'accept mission' to start, or cancel
- separate map for new location


- handle rescale when using different screen resolution.
