I think we should use a voxel engine for building 3d worlds. I think the missions should be verbal geometric description, and the player should build a world in order to run an FDTD simulation. The simulation would run in the background, and then could be viewed. The question would be "where should we place our transmitter/receiver". Once the slow sim was done, the game would be playable in the created 3D world, and the results of the slow sim would be useable for computing strengths in a real-time game. There would be a way to upload the results of the slow sim for others to use.
