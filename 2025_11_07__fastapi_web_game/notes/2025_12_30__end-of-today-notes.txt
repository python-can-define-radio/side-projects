1. Decide engine: 
  a. https://github.com/fenomas/noa  or
  b.  https://www.reddit.com/r/VoxelGameDev/comments/wny62d/opensource_web_voxel_engine/
      that engine on github: https://github.com/skishore/wave
  I think we're leaning towards the skishore one.
2. Either start migrating to new engine, or fix collision with staircases in current game.
